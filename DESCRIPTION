Title: Outlier detection in multiple sequence alignments
Version: 1.34.0
Date: 2015-12-20
Author: José Jiménez
Maintainer: José Jiménez <jose@jimenezluna.com>
Description: Performs outlier detection of sequences in a multiple
        sequence alignment using bootstrap of predefined distance
        metrics. Outlier sequences can make downstream analyses
        unreliable or make the alignments less accurate while they are
        being constructed. This package implements the OD-seq algorithm
        proposed by Jehl et al (doi 10.1186/s12859-015-0702-1) for
        aligned sequences and a variant using string kernels for
        unaligned sequences.
